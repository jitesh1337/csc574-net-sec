INTRODUCTION
This is a set of example programs demonstrating how to perform
basic tasks with OpenSSL. There are five programs:

wclient	    -- a simple web client emulator
wserver	    -- a simple web server emulator
wclient2    -- a version of wclient with some extra options
	       including setting the cipher suite and 
	       session caching.
wserver2    -- a version of wserver2 with some extra options
	       including setting the cipher suite, client
	       authentication, rehandshake, and session caching.
sclient	    -- a simple client program that echos from the keyboard
	       to the server and vice versa. sclient is a simple
	       model of a terminal client such as Telnet.

See the file RUNNING for documentation on the command line
switches for these programs.

DOCUMENTATION
Although the programs are extensively commented they are not
completely self-explanatory. Rather, they are intended to be used as a
companion to a series of articles published in Linux Journal. The
first article was published in the September issue and is included
here as part1.pdf. The second article was published on the web
in early October and is included here as part2.pdf

This explains why we have both wclient and wclient2 (and wserver and
wserver2). The first editions appear in the first article and the
second ones in the second article. This structure also lets the
reader learn the basics without advanced features getting in the
way.

BUILDING
These programs are designed to build with GNU autoconf. 
With any luck you can build simply by doing

	./configure
	make

If the configure script can't find OpenSSL, it will exit with an
error. If your OpenSSL is in a nonstandard location, you will need to
give configure a hint with the '--with-openssl' or
'--with-openssl-{lib,include}' switches.

If you have some problem building this software, please send
a bug report to <ekr@rtfm.com>.
